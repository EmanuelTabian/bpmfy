# BPMfy

BPMfy is a lightweight app designed for DJs and music enthusiasts who want to easily find and match songs by their BPM (beats per minute). The goal is to simplify the process of building smooth, perfectly timed sets by providing quick access to track metadata, BPM suggestions, and smart matching features.

This project is in its early stages — the tech stack and features are still being defined — but the vision is clear: make BPM matching effortless and fun.
